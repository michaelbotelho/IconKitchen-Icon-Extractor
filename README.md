## IconKitchen Icon Extractor
Simple script to automate the process of extracting the icons you generated with icon.kitchen. Since icon.kitchen forces the user to generate and download icons individually, I found it tedious to unzip every icon folder and scan for the desired icon. 
I created this so the user can simply design icons and download them as if they are downloading just the PNG icon file.

### Usage
1. Download icon zip files into a directory ```dir```
2. Place the executable ```Extract Icons.exe``` in the directory ```dir```
3. Run the executable
4. All zip folders will be replaced by the respective PNG file with the same name, and all other folders will be removed.
